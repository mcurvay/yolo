## This repository is for my Comp. Vision Lecture (lead by Dr. Osman AkÄ±n)

I made a YOLO v8  implementation .
i used a dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aeeeeeep/apple-single-object-detection) which contains more than 4000 pictures

i put some result pics and a short video
but my model needs some more exercise :))  

i made also a ui for checking single pictures
